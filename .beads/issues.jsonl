Add webhook endpoint at /api/webhooks/github\n2. Parse push events, check if .beads/issues.jsonl changed\n3. Diff old vs new issues to detect what changed (status, assignee, etc.)\n4. Send email notifications via Resend/SendGrid/Mailgun\n5. Update README.md with instructions for repo owners to set up webhooks\n\n## Requirements\n- Store user emails (add user:email scope to GitHub OAuth)\n- Add email preferences (what to notify on, opt-out)\n- Webhook endpoint must verify GitHub signature (X-Hub-Signature-256)\n- README section: how repo owners add webhook pointing to the app\n\n## Who gets notified\n- Assignee on assignment/status changes\n- Issue creator on status changes\n- (Future: watchers/subscribers)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-04T13:39:25.1867-08:00","updated_at":"2026-01-04T13:39:25.1867-08:00"}
